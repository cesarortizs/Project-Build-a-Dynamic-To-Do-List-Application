The project is a dynamic to-do list application, it provides a form to create new tasks which will be rendered in the page, we can delete any task if we want or we can mark it as completed, this will strike through its name to distinguish it from the uncompleted ones.

We can search for any specific tasks names in the search bar, this will only show us the tasks which include that name, if we try to search for a task without providing any text it will return us the full list of tasks again, finally it has a counter on the footer which will be updated whenever a task is created or deleted.
